What's a CMS?
-------------

*A web content management system is a software system that provides website authoring, collaboration, and administration tools designed to allow users with little knowledge of web programming languages to create and manage website content with relative ease. [...] A WCMS typically requires a systems administrator and/or a web developer to set up and add features, but it is primarily a website maintenance tool for non-technical staff.* -- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_content_management_system)

GoogleCms is centred around Google Doc's text editor and file manager. The idea is that GoogleCms syncronises a Google Doc's folder with the webserver. Files are just downloaded, but when it comes to a Google Document, it actually turns it into a proper webpage. This is treatement consists on several steps:
- Download the images contained in the document
- Add javascipt anti-spam protection to the emails
- Save the page content in a .php file
